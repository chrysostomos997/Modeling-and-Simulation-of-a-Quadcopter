Optimal Control of a Quadcopter (LQR/LQG).


This paper was written as part of my undergraduate studies in Industrial Engineering and Management 
(Department of Automation Engineering) of International Hellenic University. To begin with, there is and
introduction focusing on the general and historical evidence on UAVs; including the quadcopter, that is 
the main topic of the study. The creation of the non-linear mathematical model will follow, profiting from 
the study of the kinematic and dynamic analysis of the quadcopter. The next chapter deals with the 
linearization of the model in Matlab and the analysis of the optimum control and the optimum controllers
(LQR & LQG). Furthermore, the simulations for different situations and the 3D animations used for the 
realistic representation of the quadcopter’s track will be presented, as well as the analysis of the 
controllers’ impact. In the end, the created code will be presented with the aim of reaching conclusions.
